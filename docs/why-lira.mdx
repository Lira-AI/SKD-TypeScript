## Alternatives in the Market

1. #### Direct Integration with Individual Providers

   - **Complex and Inconsistent**: Each provider has its own signatures. Request and response formats may be very different.
   - **High Maintenance**: Managing multiple integrations increases complexity and upkeep.

2. #### Building Custom Abstraction Layers

   - **Time-Consuming Development**: Creating a unified API from scratch requires significant effort.
   - **Ongoing Maintenance**: Continuous updates needed to keep up with provider API changes and new features.

3. #### Using Existing SDKs and Libraries
   - **Feature Limitations**: Often lack unified logging, structured storage, or custom metadata support.
   - **Steep Learning Curve**: May not fully abstract provider-specific quirks, making understanding and debugging difficult.
