## Why use the generate mode?

<Card title="Unified API" icon="circles-overlap" horizontal="true">
  Same API for all supported LLM providers. Switch between providers without
  changing a single line of code. Just change the model name.
</Card>

<Card title="No vendor lock-in" icon="lock-open" horizontal="true">
  Easily switch between various providers without vendor lock-in. The unified
  interface abstracts away differences between provider APIs, allowing seamless
  integration with various LLMs.
</Card>

## How it works

## Create a new message

The `create` method generates a new message based on the options provided.

```typescript
import { Lira } from 'lira'

const lira = new Lira()

const res = await lira.message.create()
```

See the [SDK references](/sdk-reference/messages/input) for more details.
