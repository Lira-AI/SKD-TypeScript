## Why use the generate mode?

You can use the `generate` mode to generate responses from different LLM providers using the same API. This mode is ideal for scenarios where you want to generate responses from different LLM providers without storing the messages.

<Card title="Unified API" icon="circles-overlap" horizontal="true">
  Same API for all supported LLM providers. Switch between providers without
  changing a single line of code. Our API abstracts provider differences,
  ensuring uniform input and output formats across all providers.
</Card>

<Card title="No vendor lock-in" icon="lock-open" horizontal="true">
  Easily switch between various providers without vendor lock-in. The unified
  interface abstracts away differences between provider APIs, allowing seamless
  changes between various LLMs.

## Generate a new message without storing it

When creating a new message, you can use the `create` method to generate a response from the LLM provider. By default the storing option is enabled, which means the message request and response will be stored ([Store mode](/modes/store)). To disable storing the message, you can set the `store.disabled` option to `true`.

#### Disable storing `globally`:

```typescript
import { Lira } from 'lira'

const lira = new Lira({
  store: {
    disabled: false,
  },
})

const res = await lira.message.create()
```

#### Disable storing `per-request`:

```typescript
import { Lira } from 'lira'

const lira = new Lira()

const res = await lira.message.create({
  lira: {
    store: {
      disabled: false,
    },
  },
})
```
