## Why use the store mode?

You can use the `store` mode to store messages genereted by one of the supported LLM providers (`OpenAI` or `Anthropic`) or from any other provider. This mode is ideal for scenarios where you want to use your own instance of the LLM provider (or even a custom one) and store the messages in a structured way.

## Store a message

Storing a message is as simple as calling the `store` method. You can store a message genereted by one of the supported providers (`OpenAI` or `Anthropic`) or any other provider (or even a custom one).

#### Anthropic:

See the [Anthropic store reference](/sdk-reference/store/anthropic) for more details.

```typescript
import { Lira } from 'lira'

const lira = new Lira()

await lira.store.anthropic.message()
```

#### OpenAI:

See the [OpenAI store reference](/sdk-reference/store/openai) for more details.

```typescript
import { Lira } from 'lira'

const lira = new Lira()

await lira.store.openai.message()
```

#### Custom provider:

See the [Custom provider store reference](/sdk-reference/store/message) for more details.

```typescript
import { Lira } from 'lira'

const lira = new Lira()

await lira.store.message()
```
