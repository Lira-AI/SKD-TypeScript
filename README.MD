# What is Lira?

Lira is an **open-source** SDK that lets you **store** every LLM interaction in a structured format to **test and optimize** your AI integrations based on data-driven insights. It also provides a unified API to **generate** responses with any LLM provider.

You can chose to store data in your own database, ensuring it never leaves your server, or through the Lira dashboard for clear visibility and performance tracking across LLMs interactions.

The unified API lets you switch LLM providers simply by changing the model name, without ever modifying your code. Focus on building your application using the **best LLM provider** for your needs.
